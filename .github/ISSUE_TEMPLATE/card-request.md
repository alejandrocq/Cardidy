Hello,

I would like to be able to generate randomize valid XXX card.

| Issuing network | IIN ranges | Active | Length |  Validation |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| XXX | 42, 1336-1338 | Yes | 16 | Luhn |

If you want to solve this issue, check this [how-to guide]( https://github.com/d-edge/Cardidy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-new-card).

Cheers,
